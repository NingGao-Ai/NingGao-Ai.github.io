### Image Restoration

**Efficient Frequency-Domain Image Deraining with Contrastive Regularization** [ [PDF] ](/files/ECCV2024_Deraining.pdf)
* **Publication:** ECCV 2024
* **Authors:** Ning Gao, Xingyu Jiang, Xiuhui Zhang, Yue Deng
* **Abstract:** This article innovatively explores the aggregation and separability of frequency domain transformation for rain line noise, and relies on the global feature extraction inherent in the transformation to replace visual attention in achieving a more efficient Transformer architecture for rain removal tasks.
